## Why Imgen and where it can help you?

Imgen is an outcome of my frustration when I was working on a project for a SEO Expert client. It was a portfolio website which served a lot of images in different size variations. You could upload an image and required size variations were created.
Everything fine so far, until I had to change size variations of every image already uploaded along with the file name... multiple times. Ouch!

If you are in a familiar situation like me, your requirements change dynamically or you just want to be *agile* when it comes to images, Imgen is here to help you out.
